        <h1>Biography</h1>
        <div id="img"><img src="images/profile.png" alt="profile"></div>
        <p>My name is Syed Muhammad Talha Hussain, which can be shortened to 
            just Syed Hussain with the middle initial as T. 

            I am a Computer Science Major at the CUNY-Hunter College expected to graduate by 
            May 2022.
        </p>
        <p>To start off, I am from Pakistan, and even though i was born in the United States, much of my early life was spent in my home country.
            I grew up in my home country and my starting education from pre school till mid 5th grade
            was finished there. This I believe was a good call, because it helped me stay within
            and learn about my roots. When I was 11, our family fully moved to the United States, and i began the rest of my education here.
        </p>
        <p> I began to take a liking to Computer Science in 11th grade, when I took my first
            computer Science class. From there on, I got really interested in Computer Science 
            and that is what began my interests in progressing furhter in CS in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have taken part in many projects through college so far, and much of
            these projects deal with C++, so therefore, i can say that
            I am very good and using C++. There have been other languages
            that we learned discreetly, which include, Python, C and Machine Learning.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            ..............................................................................
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, my main goal is to gain as much experience as possible, so that
            after I graduate, I can easily find jobs. To start this off, I plan of doing internships 
            and gaining some sort of work experience that builds my Resume.
