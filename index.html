        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>My name is Syed Muhammad Talha Hussain (Syed Hussain). 

            I am a Computer Science Major at the CUNY-Hunter College expected to graduate by 
            May 2022.
        </p>
        <p> I began to take a liking to Computer Science in 11th grade, when I took my first
            Computer Science class. From there on, I got really interested in Computer Science 
            and that is what began my interests in progressing furhter in CS in the future.
        </p>
        <h2> Experience </h2>
        <p>
            I have taken part in many projects much of which deal with C++, I can implement the langugage pretty well 
            and can easily understand languages that are similar to it. These languages 
            include, Python, JavaScript and etc. I have also discreetly learned Machine Learning.
            
        </p>

        <p>
            Learning to code better and getting more proficient is always on my mind, as I hope to 
            become better in the field. I want to be able to think more efficiently at probllem solving and
            think of quicker ways to solve problems. I also want to work with other people to better understand
            how otehr people approach a certain problem. Moreover, I want to be able to help others
            with anyhting I can. 
        </p>
        <p>
            ..............................................................................
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, my main goal is to gain as much experience as possible, so that
            after I graduate, I can easily find jobs. To start this off, I plan of doing internships 
            and gaining some sort of work experience that builds my Resume. 
        </p>

        <h2> Hobbies </h2>

        <p> I am a very athletic person and play alot of sports. My favorite sports include
            soccer, badminton, tennis and volleyball. I also play alot of videogames. I love to spend
            time with my friends outside. I am also a part-time religious teacher/leader for kids and adults.
            I also love to assist younger kids with their studies whenever i can, in any subject.
